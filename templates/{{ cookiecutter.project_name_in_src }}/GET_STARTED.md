# Get Started with your template

You created this tool with the ml wrapper template.
You will find your skeleton in [{{ cookiecutter.ml_tool_name }}.py](./src/{{ cookiecutter.project_name_in_src }}/{{ cookiecutter.ml_tool_name }}.py).

We even provided a predefined CI for you. This template has overwritten files if they already existed.




## Debugging
The variables you provided have been:

```
{{ cookiecutter | safe }}
```
